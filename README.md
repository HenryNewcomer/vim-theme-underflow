Note that these colors were chosen with 256-bit color in mind.

## Installation
Vim Plug: add `Plug: 'HenryNewcomer/vim-theme-underflow'` within the plugin
area. After, the plug#end() area, add `colorscheme underflow`.

If using another plugin manager, such as Vundle, the steps are appropriately
similar. Just reference your plugin manager's manual for further assistance.

## Manual Installation
Linux/Mac OS) If on a Unix-based OS, simply clone/save this and place it in your
 ~/.vim/colors/ directory (assuming you haven't changed this path).
